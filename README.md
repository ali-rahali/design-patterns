# _Design Patterns_
### One of the most important things developer has to know are design patterns.
### Books to study:
* [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Object-Oriented-Addison-Wesley-Professional-ebook/dp/B000SEIBB8)
* [Head First Design Patterns: A Brain-Friendly Guide](https://www.amazon.com/Head-First-Design-Patterns-Brain-Friendly-ebook/dp/B00AA36RZY/ref=pd_sim_351_2?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=MPZNFK8KARWAYCJFFHAA)


#### What is the main goal of this repository, one might ask?
#### It's always good idea to learn something new, and, actually, without knowing design patterns it's impossible to create robust applications.
#### So I've decided to study aforementioned books to level up my software expertise.
